<h2>1.Early Life</h2>
<p>
I became aware of my parents' desire for me to pursue a B.Com career in my early years. I decided to study in engineer before dropping out the B.COM of college in 2019 since I wanted to be an engineer but my parents wouldn't let me. It took me a lot of effort to pass the FSAT Exam that Freshworks was offering, so I gave Freshworks Software Academy another shot.
I went to the Freshworks office to participate in the interview after clearing the FSAT exam. Soon after, I received a letter from Freshworks confirming that I had been accepted as a student at the Freshworks Software Academy.
